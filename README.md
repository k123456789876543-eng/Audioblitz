# 🎧 AuraBoost

> *Calm the fear. Own the moment.*

**AuraBoost** is a cross-platform confidence and focus app built for introverts, anxiety-prone individuals, and performers who need an instant mental edge before high-stakes moments — whether that's speaking in front of 100,000 people, walking into a critical meeting, or simply getting out the door on a hard day.

It delivers scientifically-inspired binaural beats, solfeggio frequencies, and generative ambient soundscapes through headphones, with effects typically onset in 5–20 minutes.

## Why AuraBoost

Stage fright is physiological. Before a high-pressure event, cortisol spikes, heart rate climbs, and the prefrontal cortex — responsible for clear thinking — goes partially offline. Traditional advice like "just breathe" or "picture the audience in their underwear" doesn't touch the neurological root of anxiety.

AuraBoost works differently. By delivering precisely-tuned binaural beats through headphones, it entrains brainwave activity toward alpha and theta states associated with calm alertness. Ambient soundscapes provide a sensory anchor. Subliminal affirmations at –30dB prime confidence without conscious resistance. Together, these inputs create a neurological environment where peak performance becomes the path of least resistance.

The app is designed for people who feel deeply, think in overdrive, and just need the right conditions to let their real self show up.

## The Science

### Binaural Beats & Frequency Following Response

When two slightly different sine wave frequencies are delivered to each ear separately (e.g., 200Hz left, 210Hz right), the brain perceives a phantom beat at the difference frequency (10Hz). This perceived beat is not an auditory illusion — it produces a measurable shift in brainwave activity toward the target frequency, a phenomenon called the **Frequency Following Response (FFR)**.

| Brainwave Band | Frequency Range | Associated State | AuraBoost Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| Delta | 0.5 – 4 Hz | Deep sleep, recovery | Post-event reset, sleep pack |
| Theta | 4 – 8 Hz | Deep relaxation, creativity | Pre-stage calm, anxiety reduction |
| Alpha | 8 – 14 Hz | Calm alertness, flow state | Stage King mode, focus |
| Beta | 14 – 30 Hz | Active thinking, engagement | Dopamine boost, social ease |
| Gamma | 30+ Hz | Hyper-focus, peak cognition | Advanced premium pack |

### Solfeggio Frequencies

Ancient tonal scales that certain researchers associate with physiological and psychological effects. AuraBoost uses them as binaural carrier frequencies — the science is debated but the user experience is consistent and positive.

| Frequency | Traditional Name | AuraBoost Association |
|---|---|---|
| 396 Hz | UT | Fear release |
| 528 Hz | MI | Confidence & transformation |
| 639 Hz | FA | Connection & social ease |
| 741 Hz | SOL | Expression & voice clarity |
| 852 Hz | LA | Intuition & spiritual order |

### Cortisol & Dopamine Pathway

Repetitive rhythmic audio stimulation activates the brain's reward entrainment system — the same circuit involved in music-induced chills and runner's high. This produces modest dopamine release without any substance, building positive association with the pre-performance ritual over time. Users report that AuraBoost sessions become an anchor — a learned neurological shortcut to calm confidence.

> **Important:** AuraBoost is scientifically-inspired, not clinically certified. It does not diagnose, treat, or cure any condition. For clinical anxiety disorders, please consult a licensed professional.

```

### Boost (Home)
The primary screen. The animated aurora background responds to whether audio is playing. The central orb acts as the play/pause button with a circular progress ring. Below it: duration pills, tone mode toggle, mix sliders for binaural and ambient volume, a horizontal preset carousel, and the Emergency Boost CTA banner.

### Studio (Mixer)
A layered mixing desk interface. Top section selects the solfeggio base frequency from a horizontal scrollable row. Below that, the ambient type selector. Then the 4 sound layers — each with an on/off toggle and a custom-colored volume slider. A live waveform preview bar with a preview button sits at the bottom, above the save-mix input.

### Sounds (Library)
A catalog view. Solfeggio frequency entries are interactive rows that play a preview tone when tapped. Ambient soundscape cards are displayed in a 2-column grid. Binaural pack cards show free/pro status badges.

### Journey (Progress)
Three stat tiles at the top (sessions, minutes, average mood). Pending session mood rating prompt appears when a session has been completed but not yet rated. Insight banner auto-generates based on session patterns. Badge grid (3-column) shows earned and locked states. Streak calendar. Reverse-chronological session history list.

### Profile
User avatar orb, level badge, and earned tags. Anxiety profile bar chart. App settings toggles (notifications, haptics, offline downloads). Subliminal volume slider. Science footnote. Pro upgrade card.

### Onboarding
3-step quiz with smooth page transitions. Each step presents a question with 4 tappable answers. Selections are not validated — any answer advances the flow. Results are stored locally and used to seed the personalization engine.

### Emergency Modal
Full-screen overlay with aurora background. Phase 1: 3-second countdown with gold typography. Phase 2: animated breathing orb with scale transitions (inhale expand, exhale contract), rotating affirmations, waveform, and a linear progress bar. Phase 3: completion screen with "You Are Ready" message.

## Audio Engine

### Web Implementation (Prototype)
The React prototype uses the **Web Audio API** directly — no external audio files required. All sound is synthesized in real time.

**Binaural beats** use a `ChannelMergerNode` to create true stereo output:
```
OscillatorNode (baseHz) → GainNode → ChannelMergerNode (left channel)
OscillatorNode (baseHz + beatHz) → GainNode → ChannelMergerNode (right channel)
ChannelMergerNode → MasterGainNode → AudioContext.destination
```

**Ambient soundscapes** are generated from raw PCM `AudioBuffer` objects:
- Rain: White noise with amplitude modulation
- Ocean: Slow sinusoidal amplitude envelope with noise layer
- Fire: Pink-ish noise with random crackle impulses
- Forest: Low-frequency wind shimmer with leaf rustle layer
- Wind: Amplitude-modulated sine with noise

All ambient buffers are 4 seconds long and loop seamlessly. A low-pass `BiquadFilterNode` shapes the tone for each type.

**Isochronic tones** use a square-wave LFO connected to an oscillator's gain:
```
OscillatorNode (carrier) → GainNode ← LFO OscillatorNode (beatHz, square wave)
GainNode → MasterGainNode
```

Volume transitions use `setTargetAtTime` for smooth parameter changes without zipper noise.

### Flutter Native Implementation

For production iOS/Android builds, replace the Web Audio engine with:

```dart
// Binaural engine uses flutter_sound for raw PCM playback
// Generates 32-bit float samples at 44100Hz
// Left channel: sin(2π × baseHz × t)
// Right channel: sin(2π × (baseHz + beatHz) × t)
// Feeds to FlutterSoundPlayer via startPlayerFromStream
```

Key packages:
- `flutter_sound: ^9.2.13` — PCM stream playback, binaural generation
- `just_audio: ^0.9.36` — Ambient MP3/WAV loop playback
- `audio_session: ^0.1.18` — Background audio, interruption handling

The ambient layer uses pre-mastered 320kbps MP3 files bundled in `assets/audio/` rather than runtime synthesis, ensuring consistent audio quality across all devices.

---

## Firebase Setup

### 1. Create a Firebase Project

Go to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com) → Add project → name it `auraboost-prod`.

### 2. Enable Services

In the Firebase Console:
- **Authentication** → Sign-in method → Enable "Anonymous" and "Email/Password"
- **Firestore Database** → Create database → Start in production mode
- **Storage** → Get started (for user-uploaded ambiences)
- **ML Kit** → Custom models (upload personalization model)

### 3. Firestore Schema

```
/users/{userId}
  - email: string
  - createdAt: timestamp
  - profile: {
      anxietyTrigger: string,
      preferredAmbient: string,
      preferredFreqHz: number
    }

  /sessions/{sessionId}
    - presetId: number
    - presetName: string
    - durationMin: number
    - mood: number (0–4, null if unrated)
    - beatHz: number
    - ambientType: string
    - completedAt: timestamp

  /mixes/{mixId}
    - name: string
    - baseFreqHz: number
    - beatHz: number
    - ambientType: string
    - layers: array
    - createdAt: timestamp

/presets/{presetId}           # (read-only, seeded by admin)
  - name: string
  - beatHz: number
  - baseHz: number
  - ambient: string
  - isPremium: boolean
```

### 4. Firestore Security Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    // Presets are public read
    match /presets/{presetId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Run Firebase Emulator (local dev)

```bash
firebase emulators:start --only auth,firestore,storage
```

Then in `main.dart`, point to emulator when in debug mode:
```dart
if (kDebugMode) {
  await FirebaseFirestore.instance.useFirestoreEmulator('localhost', 8080);
  await FirebaseAuth.instance.useAuthEmulator('localhost', 9099);
}
```

---

## Running on iOS

```bash
# Open in Xcode first to configure signing
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace

# Then run from terminal
flutter run -d iPhone  # or specific device ID

# Release build
flutter build ipa --release
```

**Required iOS permissions** (add to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`):
```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>AuraBoost uses the microphone for camera-based heart rate monitoring.</string>

<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>AuraBoost optionally uses the camera to measure your heart rate.</string>

<key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
<string>AuraBoost reads heart rate data to adapt audio intensity during sessions.</string>

<key>NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription</key>
<string>AuraBoost logs session mindfulness minutes to Apple Health.</string>

<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>audio</string>
</array>
```

**HealthKit entitlements** (`ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements`):
```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.healthkit</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.developer.healthkit.access</key>
<array>
  <string>health-records</string>
</array>
```

---

## Running on Android

```bash
# Run on connected device or emulator
flutter run -d android

# Release APK
flutter build apk --release

# Release App Bundle (for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release
```

**Required Android permissions** (add to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`):
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK"/>

<!-- For background audio playback -->
<service
  android:name=".AudioPlayerService"
  android:foregroundServiceType="mediaPlayback"
  android:exported="false"/>
```

**Minimum SDK**: 23 (Android 6.0) — set in `android/app/build.gradle`:
```gradle
defaultConfig {
    minSdkVersion 23
    targetSdkVersion 34
}
```

---

## Running as Web App (React Prototype)

The React prototype (`AuraBoost.jsx`) can be run in any environment that supports React and JSX:

```bash
# With Vite
npm create vite@latest auraboost-web -- --template react
cd auraboost-web
# Replace src/App.jsx with AuraBoost.jsx content
npm install
npm run dev

# With Create React App
npx create-react-app auraboost-web
cd auraboost-web
# Replace src/App.js with AuraBoost.jsx content
npm start
```

> **Note:** The Web Audio API requires a user gesture to initialize the `AudioContext`. The play button tap serves as this gesture. For best results, use Google Chrome or Safari. Firefox has minor Web Audio quirks.

> **Headphones required.** Binaural beats have no effect through speakers — both channels merge into the same air before reaching your ears, cancelling the beat frequency. The app warns users of this.

## Personalization Engine

AuraBoost uses a lightweight on-device model (no cloud inference calls) built on Firebase ML Kit. The model is a simple weighted scoring function rather than a neural network, keeping it fast, private, and interpretable.

### Input Features

- Anxiety trigger type (from onboarding: crowds, social, performance, general)
- Time of day (morning / afternoon / evening / night)
- Session duration history (avg, trend)
- Mood ratings per preset (exponentially weighted toward recent)
- Ambient type preference (frequency of each type used)
- Beat frequency preference (derived from preset usage patterns)

### Scoring Formula

```dart
double scorePreset(Preset p, UserProfile profile) {
  double score = 0;
  // Mood signal: sessions with this preset rated ≥3 boost score
  score += profile.moodByPreset[p.id]?.weightedAverage ?? 0;
  // Recency: presets used in last 3 days get a boost
  score += profile.lastUsed[p.id] != null
    && DateTime.now().difference(profile.lastUsed[p.id]!).inDays < 3 ? 0.5 : 0;
  // Anxiety fit: crowd anxiety → Stage King / Crown Surge
  if (profile.anxietyTrigger == "crowds" && p.tags.contains("confidence"))
    score += 1.0;
  // Time fit: delta presets recommended at night
  if (DateTime.now().hour >= 21 && p.beatHz < 6)
    score += 0.8;
  return score;
}
```

### Model Update Cycle

The model weights are updated locally after every 5 completed sessions. No data leaves the device unless the user opts into anonymous telemetry (opt-out by default).

## Monetization

### Free Tier

- 3 binaural presets (Stage King, Deep Calm, Fire Focus)
- 3 saved custom mixes
- 5-min Emergency Boost
- All solfeggio frequency previews
- Basic mood logging and 3 badges

### Pro ($4.99/year)

- All 6 presets + future additions
- Unlimited saved custom mixes
- HR-adaptive session intensity
- All 4 binaural packs (20+ tracks)
- Premium ambient packs
- Subliminal affirmation customization
- Advanced insights and analytics
- Priority support

### One-Time Packs (future)

Individual ambient packs at $0.99 each for users who want specific add-ons without full Pro.

### Implementation

In-app purchases via `in_app_purchase` package (StoreKit 2 on iOS, Google Play Billing on Android). Entitlement management handled by RevenueCat to normalize across platforms and simplify receipt validation.

```dart
// Check entitlement
final offerings = await Purchases.getOfferings();
final isProUser = (await Purchases.getCustomerInfo())
    .entitlements.active.containsKey('pro');
```

## Accessibility

AuraBoost is designed to be fully accessible:

- **Screen reader support:** All interactive elements have semantic labels. `Semantics` widgets wrap custom controls throughout.
- **Large text:** All font sizes use `sp` units, respecting the system accessibility font scale.
- **Color contrast:** Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio on all text against backgrounds (WCAG AA compliant).
- **Touch targets:** All tappable elements are minimum 44×44dp, per Apple and Google guidelines.
- **Reduced motion:** Checks `MediaQuery.of(context).disableAnimations` and disables particle effects and aurora animations when enabled.
- **High contrast mode:** Detected via `MediaQuery.of(context).highContrast` — switches to solid fills instead of gradients.
- **No flashing content:** No animations flash more than 3 times per second (WCAG 2.3.1 compliant).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please follow this process:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. Follow the existing code style (Dart: `flutter format .`, React: Prettier with default config)
3. Write or update tests for any changed audio logic
4. Ensure `flutter test` passes with no failures
5. Open a pull request with a clear description of the change and why

### Development Guidelines

- Audio engine changes must be tested on real hardware — emulators do not reproduce audio latency accurately
- All new presets must include a name, emoji, baseHz, beatHz, ambient type, color, tags, and a description string
- New Firebase Firestore schema fields must include a migration path for existing documents
- Do not commit `.env`, `google-services.json`, or `GoogleService-Info.plist`

### Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/). Be kind, be constructive, be collaborative.
